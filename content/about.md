![Me]({{< baseurl >}}/about.jpg)
Hey there! 
I'm Dhrubo, a third-year Computer Science & Statistics student from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada. I am originally from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have recently worked as an SDET at Student Price Card Ltd. , a popular Canadian company that offers student loyalty programs. Outside work and studies, I love doing music and hiking.
