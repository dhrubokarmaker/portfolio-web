I re-created a really popular Nokia game from early 2000s - Roll2D. The game is written in Lua where I implemented the game mechanics from scratch. The goal of the game is simple - SURVIVE! 
The game currently only works on desktop cause you need keyboard controls. You can enjoy a webapp version of the game [here.](https://roll2d.netlify.app/)
