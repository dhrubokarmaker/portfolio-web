During my first semester at university, I learned about functional programming. I applied the concepts and created a responsive web application that allows users to generate a solution to a Sudoku puzzle.I implemented generative recursion, arbitary arity trees, and backtracking search algorithm in Javascript to
efficiently calculate solution in an average of 1 second.\
